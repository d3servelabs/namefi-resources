To **tokenize** something means to convert it into a digital token that exists on a blockchain. In Namefi's case, tokenizing a domain turns a real-world [DNS](/en/glossary/dns/) asset (like `mybrand.xyz`) into a tradable, programmable [NFT](/en/glossary/nft/). This token can be stored in a [wallet](/en/glossary/wallet/), transferred instantly, or integrated with [smart contracts](/en/glossary/smart-contract/). Tokenization gives domains internet-native properties like [composability](/en/glossary/composability/) and automation. It doesn't change the legal status of the domain, but it does upgrade how you can use, trade, and secure it—without relying on intermediaries.
