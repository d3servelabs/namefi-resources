**Web3** refers to the next evolution of the internet built on blockchain technology, emphasizing decentralization, user ownership, and peer-to-peer interactions rather than reliance on centralized platforms. Unlike Web2 where users create content on platforms they don't own, Web3 enables users to own their data, identity, and digital assets directly. Domains play a crucial role in Web3 as decentralized identifiers that users can own and control without intermediaries. [Tokenized](/en/glossary/tokenize/) domains become building blocks of Web3 infrastructure, serving as gateways to decentralized applications, repositories for identity credentials, and tradable digital assets that work across different blockchain networks and applications.
