**Domain ownership** traditionally refers to a registrant holding usage rights through a [registrar](/r/en/glossary/registrar/), often under restrictive terms. With Namefi, domain ownership means holding an [NFT](/r/en/glossary/nft/) in your own [wallet](/r/en/glossary/wallet/) that represents the real-world domain (e.g. `yourname.xyz`). This gives you clearer, cryptographically secured control over transfers, delegation, and integration. Instead of being subject to a registrar’s dashboard or policies, you manage your domain directly [on-chain](/r/en/glossary/on-chain/). While legal obligations (renewals, trademark rules) still apply, ownership becomes user-first and programmable—unlocking new possibilities in Web3, identity, and digital commerce.
