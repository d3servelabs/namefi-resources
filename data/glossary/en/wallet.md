A **wallet** in the crypto context is a digital tool that stores private keys and allows users to manage their blockchain-based assets. Unlike traditional wallets that hold physical currency, crypto wallets hold the [cryptographic security]({{ '/en/glossary/cryptographic-security/' | url }}) keys that prove ownership of digital assets like cryptocurrencies and [NFTs]({{ '/en/glossary/nft/' | url }}). When you tokenize a domain with Namefi, the resulting domain [NFT]({{ '/en/glossary/nft/' | url }}) is stored in your wallet, giving you direct [custodial ownership]({{ '/en/glossary/custodial-ownership/' | url }}) and control. Popular wallets include MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and hardware wallets like Ledger. Your wallet becomes your portal to manage, transfer, and interact with your tokenized domains without relying on centralized platforms.
