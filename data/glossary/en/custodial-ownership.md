**Custodial ownership** occurs when a third party holds and manages assets on behalf of the actual owner, who relies on the custodian's policies and systems to access their assets. Traditional domain ownership is largely custodial—[registrars](/r/en/glossary/registrar/) control the domain records, renewal processes, and transfer mechanisms. Even though you "own" the domain, you depend on the [registrar's](/r/en/glossary/registrar/) platform and policies to manage it. [Tokenized](/r/en/glossary/tokenize/) domains shift toward self-custody, where you directly control the ownership token in your own [wallet](/r/en/glossary/wallet/). While some aspects (like [DNS](/r/en/glossary/dns/) management) may still involve custodial services, the core ownership becomes self-sovereign and independent of any single service provider's policies or continued operation.
