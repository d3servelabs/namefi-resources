**Permissionless** refers to systems that allow anyone to participate without requiring approval from a central authority. In blockchain contexts, permissionless networks let users transact, build applications, or interact with protocols without gatekeepers. Traditional domain management requires permission from [registrars](/r/en/glossary/registrar/) and follows their policies, but tokenized domains on Namefi enable permissionless transfers and integrations. Once you own a tokenized domain, you can trade it, use it in DeFi protocols, or build applications around it without seeking approval from intermediaries—as long as the underlying blockchain network is accessible to you.
