**UDRP (Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy)** is [ICANN](/r/en/glossary/icann/)'s mandatory policy for resolving disputes over domain name registrations, particularly cases involving trademark infringement or cybersquatting. UDRP provides a faster, cheaper alternative to court litigation for trademark holders to challenge domain registrations they believe infringe their rights. Even when domains are tokenized, UDRP obligations typically remain in effect since the underlying [DNS](/r/en/glossary/dns/) registration is still subject to [ICANN](/r/en/glossary/icann/) policies. Domain tokenization doesn't provide immunity from legitimate trademark disputes, and [smart contracts](/r/en/glossary/smart-contract/) may need to accommodate UDRP decisions that could affect domain ownership or control.
