A **protocol asset** is a digital asset that serves as a fundamental building block or infrastructure component within a blockchain protocol or decentralized system. These assets often have utility beyond simple value storage, providing functionality that other applications and services can build upon. [Tokenized](/r/en/glossary/tokenize/) domains function as protocol assets by serving as identity layers, namespace systems, and integration points for Web3 applications. They provide utility to the broader ecosystem while being [composable](/r/en/glossary/composability/) with other protocols. For example, a [tokenized](/r/en/glossary/tokenize/) domain might serve as [collateral](/r/en/glossary/collateral/) in DeFi, identity in social protocols, and naming in [wallet](/r/en/glossary/wallet/) systems—making it a multi-functional protocol asset.
