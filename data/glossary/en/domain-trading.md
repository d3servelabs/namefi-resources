**Domain trading** refers to the buying and selling of domain names as investment assets, similar to trading stocks or real estate. Traditional domain trading involves lengthy transfer processes, [escrow](/en/glossary/escrow/) services, and limited liquidity. [Tokenized](/en/glossary/tokenize/) domains transform trading by enabling instant transfers, transparent price history, and access to broader liquidity pools through [NFT](/en/glossary/nft/) [marketplaces](/en/glossary/marketplace/). Traders can now use familiar Web3 tools to manage domain portfolios, execute trades 24/7, and access sophisticated trading features like automated market makers or [fractional ownership](/en/glossary/fractional-ownership/). This creates a more efficient and accessible market for domain investors while providing better price discovery and reduced transaction costs.
