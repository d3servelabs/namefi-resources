**Marketplaces** like OpenSea and Blur are platforms where users can buy, sell, and trade [NFTs](/r/en/glossary/nft/), including tokenized domains. These platforms provide user-friendly interfaces for discovering assets, making offers, and completing transactions while connecting to users' [wallets](/r/en/glossary/wallet/). Traditional domain marketplaces like Sedo or Afternic require centralized [escrow](/r/en/glossary/escrow/) and manual transfer processes, while [NFT](/r/en/glossary/nft/) marketplaces enable instant, trustless trading through [smart contracts](/r/en/glossary/smart-contract/). When domains are tokenized as [NFTs](/r/en/glossary/nft/), they gain access to the entire [NFT](/r/en/glossary/nft/) ecosystem, benefiting from improved liquidity, transparent price history, and integration with broader [Web3](/r/en/glossary/web3/) infrastructure that serves millions of users globally.
