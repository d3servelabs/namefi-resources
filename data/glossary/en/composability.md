**Composability** refers to the ability to combine different protocols, applications, or assets like building blocks to create new functionality. In [Web3](/en/glossary/web3/), composable systems can seamlessly integrate with each other without requiring custom partnerships or complex integrations. Tokenized domains on Namefi are inherently composable—they can be used as [collateral](/en/glossary/collateral/) in [lending protocols](/en/glossary/lending-protocol/), integrated into identity systems, combined with other [NFTs](/en/glossary/nft/), or utilized in DeFi applications. This composability unlocks new use cases that weren't possible with traditional domain management, where domains were siloed within [registrar](/en/glossary/registrar/) systems and couldn't easily interact with other digital services.
