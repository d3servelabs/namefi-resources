The **DNS (Domain Name System)** is the internet's phonebook—a hierarchical system that translates human-readable domain names like `google.com` into IP addresses that computers use to locate servers. DNS is managed by a global network of servers and governed by [ICANN](/r/en/glossary/icann/) through registries and [registrars](/r/en/glossary/registrar/). When Namefi tokenizes a domain, the underlying DNS functionality remains intact, but ownership and management become decentralized. The tokenized domain [NFT](/r/en/glossary/nft/) represents ownership rights to the DNS name, allowing blockchain-based transfers and management while the domain continues to resolve normally on the internet through traditional DNS infrastructure.
