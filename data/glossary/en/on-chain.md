**On-chain** refers to data, assets, or actions that are recorded directly on a public blockchain. When a domain is "on-chain," its ownership and management can be verified and transferred via [smart contracts](/en/glossary/smart-contract/)—without needing approval from a centralized [registrar](/en/glossary/registrar/). Namefi uses on-chain infrastructure to turn domains into [NFTs](/en/glossary/nft/), enabling instant, [permissionless](/en/glossary/permissionless/) transfers and integration with other decentralized protocols. This structure provides greater transparency, programmability, and control to domain holders. While the underlying domain still lives in traditional [DNS](/en/glossary/dns/), its tokenized representation lives on-chain as a secure and interoperable asset.
