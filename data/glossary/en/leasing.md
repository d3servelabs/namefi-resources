**Leasing** in the domain context refers to temporarily granting usage rights to a domain while retaining ownership. Traditional domain leasing involves manual agreements and trust between parties. With tokenized domains, leasing can be automated through [smart contracts](/en/glossary/smart-contract/) that handle payments, term enforcement, and automatic reversion of control. Domain owners can earn passive income by leasing their valuable domains to businesses or projects that need them temporarily. [Smart contract](/en/glossary/smart-contract/)-based leasing eliminates the need for intermediaries, reduces costs, and ensures transparent, automatic execution of lease terms—creating new revenue streams for domain holders while providing flexible access for lessees.
