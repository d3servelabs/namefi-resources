**Automated delegation** refers to using [smart contracts](/en/glossary/smart-contract/) to automatically manage domain control and delegation based on predefined rules or conditions. Traditional domain delegation requires manual intervention to change nameservers or [DNS](/en/glossary/dns/) settings. With [tokenized](/en/glossary/tokenize/) domains, [smart contracts](/en/glossary/smart-contract/) can automatically delegate control based on factors like payment status, time-based conditions, or governance decisions. For example, a [leased](/en/glossary/leasing/) domain could automatically revert control to the owner if lease payments stop, or a [DAO](/en/glossary/dao/)-owned domain could automatically update its configuration based on community votes. This automation reduces manual overhead, eliminates human error, and enables sophisticated domain management strategies that execute reliably without intermediaries.
