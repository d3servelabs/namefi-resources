**Collateral** is an asset pledged as security for a loan, which the lender can seize if the borrower defaults. In traditional finance, collateral might be real estate, vehicles, or other valuable assets. In DeFi and [Web3](/en/glossary/web3/), collateral often consists of cryptocurrency or other digital assets locked in [smart contracts](/en/glossary/smart-contract/). Tokenized domains can serve as collateral due to their verifiable ownership, transferability, and often substantial value. A premium domain [NFT](/en/glossary/nft/) like `crypto.com` or `defi.xyz` could be used to secure loans, participate in leveraged trading, or access other financial services—all while maintaining the domain's utility and potential for appreciation.
