# Google Unveils ‘Universal Commerce Protocol’ to Power the Next Generation of AI Shopping Agents

January 15, 2026

Google is officially declaring war on the "[link tax](https://ccianet.org/advocacy/link-taxes/)" of traditional e-commerce. Earlier this week at the [National Retail Federation (NRF)](https://nrf.com/) conference, the search giant announced the release of the [Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)](https://ucp.dev/), an open-source standard designed to let AI agents—like Gemini and potentially others—handle the entire shopping lifecycle from discovery to checkout without ever leaving the chat interface.

The protocol, developed in collaboration with retail heavyweights like [Shopify](http://shopify.com), [Walmart](http://walmart.com), [Target](http://target.com), and [Etsy](http://etsy.com), aims to solve the "[N x N](https://thingsithinkithink.blog/posts/2025/04-08-the-m-x-n-problem-in-software-architecture/)" integration problem that has plagued the nascent agentic web. Until now, building an AI that could buy things meant building custom integrations for every single merchant. UCP proposes a standardized language for agents to "negotiate" with merchant backends, covering inventory checks, dynamic pricing, and secure payments.

*"AI agents will be a big part of how we shop in the not-so-distant future,"* Google CEO [Sundar Pichai](https://www.britannica.com/money/Sundar-Pichai) said in a post on X. *"UCP powers native checkout so you can buy directly on AI Mode and the Gemini app."*

### Under the Hood

Technically, UCP acts as an [abstraction layer](https://www.strata.io/glossary/abstraction-layer/). It separates the "shopping service" (checkout sessions, line items) from "capabilities" (shipping, loyalty programs). It is fully compatible with the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) and Google’s own [Agent Payments Protocol (AP2)](https://ap2-protocol.org/), signaling that Google wants to own the rails of agentic commerce, even if it doesn't own every storefront.

### The Amazon Factor

The move is a clear shot across the bow at [Amazon](http://amazon.com), which has been increasingly litigious toward AI search engines like [Perplexity](http://perplexity.ai) for scraping its product data. By creating an open standard where merchants opt-in to be scraped and sold by agents, Google is building a coalition of the willing—essentially offering retailers a way to bypass Amazon's walled garden and sell directly through the world's most popular AI models.

For now, UCP is rolling out with select partners in the US, but the message is clear: The era of SEO is ending; the era of AEO (Agent Engine Optimization) has begun.
