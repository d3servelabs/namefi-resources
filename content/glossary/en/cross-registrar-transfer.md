**Cross-registrar transfer** is the process of moving a domain from one [registrar](/en/glossary/registrar/) to another, traditionally requiring auth codes, waiting periods, and coordination between [registrars](/en/glossary/registrar/). This process can take days or weeks and may involve fees from both [registrars](/en/glossary/registrar/). With [tokenized](/en/glossary/tokenize/) domains, while the underlying [DNS](/en/glossary/dns/) registration may still require traditional transfer processes, the ownership token can be transferred instantly between [wallets](/en/glossary/wallet/). This separation allows for immediate trading and ownership changes at the token level, while [DNS](/en/glossary/dns/) management can be handled separately. Advanced tokenization models might even automate cross-registrar transfers through [smart contracts](/en/glossary/smart-contract/), significantly reducing the complexity and time required to move domains between different service providers.
