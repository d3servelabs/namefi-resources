## **What is .alsace?**

The **.alsace** extension is a geographic Top-Level Domain (GeoTLD) dedicated specifically to the Alsace region of France. Unlike generic extensions like .com or .net, or country codes like .fr, .alsace falls under the category of "new gTLDs" designed to highlight regional identity, culture, and economic activity.

Launched in 2015, this TLD was created to foster a distinct digital ecosystem for individuals, companies, and organizations linked to the Alsace territory. It is managed by the Région Grand Est with technical operations often supported by [AFNIC](https://www.afnic.fr/en/), the same registry that manages the .fr domain.

The primary purpose of .alsace is to allow entities to showcase their "Alsatian identity" online. It serves as a digital label of origin, instantly communicating to visitors that the website is connected to the linguistic, cultural, or economic landscape of this famous European region. You can learn more about the delegation of this TLD on the [ICANN wiki](https://icannwiki.org/.alsace).

## **How People Are Using .alsace**

The .alsace domain has become a powerful tool for establishing local authority and trust. Here is how various sectors are utilizing this extension:

*   **Tourism and Hospitality:** Hotels, bed and breakfasts, and tour operators use it to signal their location immediately to tourists searching for authentic experiences in Strasbourg, Colmar, or Mulhouse.
*   **Gastronomy and Viticulture:** Alsace is world-renowned for its wine. Wineries and food producers use .alsace to certify the origin of their products, which is crucial for branding in the export market.
*   **Local Small Businesses (SMEs):** Artisans and service providers use the extension to improve local SEO (Search Engine Optimization), making it easier for local customers to find them.
*   **Public Institutions and Associations:** Cultural centers and municipalities use it to foster a sense of community pride.
*   **Digital Innovation:** Tech startups based in the region's innovation hubs are using it to brand themselves as part of the European tech scene while retaining local roots.

## **Notable Entities Using .alsace**

While .alsace is a niche regional domain, it is used by major players within the region to reinforce their brand identity.

*   **Marque Alsace (marque.alsace):** This is the official territorial brand agency for the region. Their usage of the domain sets the standard for how the TLD represents regional values and economic attractiveness.
*   **Vins d'Alsace (vins.alsace):** The official site for the Alsace wine industry. This is a prime example of using a GeoTLD to categorize an entire industry's digital presence, acting as a seal of quality.
*   **Tourisme Alsace (visit.alsace):** A major travel portal that leverages the domain for clarity and search relevance, targeting international travelers planning trips to the region.

For domain investors and developers, these examples illustrate the high value placed on "keyword.alsace" domains within the French and European markets.

## **Why Choose .alsace?**

Choosing a .alsace domain offers distinct advantages over a crowded .com or a generic .fr, especially if your project has ties to the region.

*   **Stronger Local SEO:** Search engines like Google often use domain extensions as a signal of relevance. If you are targeting customers in Eastern France, a .alsace domain can help you rank higher in local search results.
*   **Availability of Premium Names:** Because it is a newer and more specific registry compared to legacy TLDs, there is a much higher chance of securing short, memorable, and keyword-rich domain names (e.g., `bakery.alsace` or `crypto.alsace`) that would be unavailable or prohibitively expensive elsewhere.
*   **Trust and Authentication:** Using this domain acts as a digital "Made in Alsace" stamp. It builds immediate trust with users who value local sourcing and regional expertise.
*   **Cultural Branding:** It connects your brand to values associated with the region: quality, tradition, and European centrality.
