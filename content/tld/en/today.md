It falls under the category of new gTLDs introduced to expand the domain name space and provide more specific and meaningful options. Approved by [ICANN](https://www.icann.org/), the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, it was created to offer businesses and individuals a domain extension that emphasizes up-to-the-minute information, daily deals, events happening now, or simply a sense of immediacy.
