## **What is .blog?**

The .blog Top-Level Domain (TLD) is a generic TLD (gTLD) specifically designed for blogs, online journals, and content-driven websites. Launched in 2016, .blog provides a clear and recognizable domain extension for anyone looking to establish a strong online presence through blogging. Unlike generic TLDs like .com, .blog instantly communicates the nature of your website to visitors. It is managed by Automattic, the company behind WordPress.com, offering a relevant and focused domain space for bloggers of all kinds. You can learn more about gTLDs on [ICANN's website](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/what-is-gtld-2012-02-25-en).
