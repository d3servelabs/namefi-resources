## **What is .agency?**

The **.agency** domain is a generic Top-Level Domain (gTLD) specifically designed to serve the vast ecosystem of service-based businesses that identify as agencies. Unlike the saturated .com or .net namespaces, .agency offers a clear, descriptive, and professional identity right in the URL.

Launched as part of [ICANN's new gTLD program](https://newgtlds.icann.org/en/about/program), .agency was created to provide a dedicated digital space for businesses ranging from advertising and marketing to real estate, insurance, and recruitment. It allows companies to shorten their web addresses by moving the word "agency" from the left side of the dot (e.g., *smithagency.com*) to the right side (e.g., *smith.agency*).

Managed by [Identity Digital](https://identity.digital/), this TLD has seen steady adoption because it immediately communicates the nature of the business to visitors before they even load the website.

## **How People Are Using .agency**

The versatility of the word "agency" makes this TLD applicable to a wide variety of industries. Here is how different sectors are leveraging this domain extension:

*   **Marketing and Advertising:** Digital marketing firms, SEO consultants, and PR houses use .agency to establish authority and creative flair.
*   **Real Estate:** Brokers and property management groups use it to differentiate themselves from general listing sites.
*   **Talent and Modeling:** Casting directors and talent management firms use it to create sleek, portfolio-focused websites.
*   **Travel and Tourism:** Boutique travel planners utilize the extension to suggest a personalized service approach.
*   **Government and Non-Profits:** Local government bodies and environmental protection groups often use it to designate official departments.
*   **Web3 and Tech:** Development shops and blockchain consultancy firms are increasingly adopting .agency to signify high-level service in the decentralized space.

## **Notable Entities Using .agency**

While many Fortune 500 companies protect their brand by registering their .agency domains, the TLD truly shines among specialized service providers who want memorable branding.

1.  **Creative Studios:** Many award-winning design boutiques have migrated to .agency addresses to secure short, one-word domain names that would be impossible to acquire on legacy TLDs.
2.  **Specialized Insurance Firms:** Niche insurance providers often use the extension to highlight their specific focus (e.g., *cybersecurity.agency* or *travel.agency*).
3.  **Digital Consultancies:** As the gig economy grows, collectives of freelancers and consultants are forming "micro-agencies" and using this TLD to project a corporate, unified front.

*Note: Due to the specific nature of this TLD, the "stars" of the .agency world are often local market leaders in real estate and marketing rather than global consumer goods brands.*

## **Why Choose .agency?**

Choosing the right domain extension is critical for your digital strategy. Here is why .agency is a smart investment:

*   **Immediate Recognition:** It describes exactly what you do. When a user sees a link ending in .agency, they expect professional services, consultation, or representation.
*   **Superior Availability:** Finding a short, catchy name on .com is becoming increasingly difficult and expensive. The .agency namespace offers a vast inventory of premium, short names that are still available for registration.
*   **Better Branding:** It allows for shorter URLs. Instead of registering `TheCreativeDesignAgency.com`, you can simply register `CreativeDesign.agency`. This is easier for clients to remember and type.
*   **SEO Relevance:** Search engines like Google treat new gTLDs just like traditional ones. However, having a relevant keyword in your TLD can improve click-through rates (CTR) because users perceive the link as highly relevant to their search query.
