## **What is .cloud?**

The .cloud Top-Level Domain (TLD) is a generic TLD (gTLD) specifically designed for individuals, businesses, and organizations involved in cloud computing, technology, and related services. It signifies a strong association with cloud technology, offering a recognizable and relevant domain extension. Launched to meet the growing demand for cloud-related online identities, .cloud provides a clear and direct way to communicate expertise and innovation in the cloud space. You can learn more about gTLDs at [ICANN's website](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/what-is-a-gtld-2012-02-25-en). It is maintained and operated by [ArvanCloud](https://www.arvancloud.com/).
