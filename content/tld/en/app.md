## **What is .app?**

The **.app** domain is a generic Top-Level Domain (gTLD) specifically designed for applications, software developers, and technology products. Launched to the general public in May 2018, it is managed by the **Google Registry**.

Unlike traditional domains like .com or .net, the .app TLD was created with a specific purpose in mind: to provide a secure and relevant home for the booming app economy. Whether it is a mobile application, a web-based tool, or a backend service, .app tells users exactly what to expect before they even click the link.

A defining characteristic of the .app domain is its focus on security. It is the first TLD to require **HTTPS** for all websites. This is achieved through the **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)** preload list. While you can buy the domain like any other, it will not resolve in a browser unless you have an SSL certificate configured. This built-in security makes .app a highly trustworthy namespace on the internet.

For more technical details on the launch and specifications, you can visit the [ICANN Wiki for .app](https://icannwiki.org/.app) or the official [Google Registry .app page](https://www.registry.google/domains/app/).

## **How People Are Using .app**

The .app extension has seen rapid adoption within the tech community. Because "app" is a universally recognized term, it bridges the gap between developers and end-users. Here is how it is currently being utilized:

*   **Mobile App Landing Pages:** Companies with apps on the Apple App Store or Google Play use .app domains (e.g., `getproduct.app`) as a central hub to provide download links, release notes, and support.
*   **Web Applications (SaaS):** Since modern software often lives in the browser, SaaS (Software as a Service) providers use .app for the actual login and interface of their product, separating it from their marketing site (often on a .com).
*   **Developer Portfolios:** Individual coders and software engineers use `lastname.app` or `projectname.app` to showcase their coding projects and resume.
*   **Documentation and Support:** Tech companies create dedicated sub-sites using .app to host API documentation or user guides.

## **Notable Entities Using .app**

Since its launch, many high-profile companies and innovative startups have adopted the TLD to signal security and relevance. Here are a few notable examples:

1.  **Cash App (cash.app):** One of the most famous examples, Cash App uses this domain for its massive peer-to-peer payment service, perfectly aligning the brand name with the URL.
2.  **Google (google.app):** As the registry operator, Google utilizes the extension for various internal projects and redirects to showcase the domain's utility.
3.  **Sitata (sitata.app):** A travel safety application that uses the domain to host its web-based services.
4.  **Puppeteer (pptr.dev / hosted apps):** While many developer tools use various extensions, the .app space is frequently populated by open-source projects hosted by the community.

If you are browsing [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/), you will notice a significant percentage of new tech launches now utilize .app addresses due to the saturation of the .com market.

## **Why Choose .app?**

Choosing the right extension is critical for your brand's digital identity. Here is why .app is a superior choice for developers and tech businesses:

*   **Built-in Security (HSTS):** As mentioned, the enforced HTTPS requirement protects your users from malware and tracking by ISPs on unsecured connections. It signals to your visitors—and search engines—that you take security seriously.
*   **Instant Recognition:** The extension describes your product immediately. If your domain ends in .app, users know they are visiting a functional tool or application.
*   **SEO Benefits:** Google has stated that HTTPS is a ranking signal. Because .app enforces HTTPS, you are adhering to best practices for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) by default.
*   **Availability:** While finding a short, one-word .com is nearly impossible or prohibitively expensive, the .app namespace still offers excellent availability for short, memorable, and brandable names.
*   **Trust Factor:** In an era of phishing and insecure sites, the green padlock associated with .app sites (due to mandatory SSL) increases user confidence.
