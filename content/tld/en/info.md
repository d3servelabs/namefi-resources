## **What is .info?**

The **.info** domain is a generic Top-Level Domain (gTLD) that stands for "information." It is one of the most recognizable and widely used domain extensions on the internet today. Unlike restricted TLDs (like .gov or .edu), .info is an open TLD, meaning anyone in the world can register a .info domain without specific restrictions.

Launched in 2001, .info was part of the first round of new gTLDs released by [ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)](https://www.icann.org/) to relieve the overcrowding of the .com namespace. Because "information" is a universally understood concept across many languages and cultures, .info quickly became a global favorite for websites dedicated to sharing knowledge, specifications, and details.

Today, it is managed by [Identity Digital](https://identity.digital/) (formerly Afilias) and remains a top choice for entities that want to signal trustworthiness and resourcefulness to their visitors.

## **How People Are Using .info**

Because the term "info" is short for "information" in over 30 languages, this TLD offers incredible versatility. Here is how different groups are leveraging it:

*   **Information Hubs and Wikis:** Developers and communities often use .info for documentation sites, wikis, and "How-To" guides.
*   **Product Support Pages:** Businesses use .info to separate their commercial sales pages (.com) from their customer support and specification sheets (e.g., `productname.info`).
*   **Event Websites:** Conferences, weddings, and festivals often utilize this TLD to provide attendees with schedules, maps, and logistical details.
*   **Public Services and Transit:** Transport agencies and public utilities frequently use .info to provide real-time updates to the public.
*   **Domain Investing and Web3:** As the digital asset space grows, investors are acquiring short, memorable .info domains to tokenize them on the blockchain, preserving value in a universally recognized extension.

## **Notable Entities Using .info**

While .com is often the default for commercial giants, many massive organizations rely on .info for their critical infrastructure and public-facing data portals.

1.  **MTA.info (Metropolitan Transportation Authority):** The primary website for New York City's public transportation network uses a .info domain, serving millions of commuters daily.
2.  **Scafellpike.info:** A dedicated resource for tourists and hikers visiting England’s highest mountain, demonstrating the TLD's strength in the travel and tourism niche.
3.  **Afilias.info:** The site for the registry backend services often utilizes the extension to demonstrate its technical reliability.

## **Why Choose .info?**

If you are debating between extensions, here is why .info might be the perfect choice for your next project:

*   **Global Clarity:** "Info" is recognized worldwide. It instantly tells the user, "You will find answers here." This reduces bounce rates because visitors know exactly what to expect.
*   **Better Availability:** Finding a short, one-word, or two-word domain on .com is nearly impossible or incredibly expensive. The .info namespace offers a much higher chance of securing your ideal brand name.
*   **SEO Relevance:** Search engines like Google treat .info as a standard gTLD. It ranks just as well as a .com or .net when high-quality content is published on it.
*   **Credibility for Content:** If your primary goal is to educate rather than sell, .info can actually feel more trustworthy and less "salesy" than commercial extensions.
*   **Cost-Effective:** Generally, .info domains are cost-effective to register and renew, making them excellent for startups and developers.
