# Namefi Astra — Critical User Journeys (CUJ)

Canonical catalog of the product's critical user journeys. Each journey has a
stable, hierarchical id (`CUJ-<Area>.<n>`) used as the join key across this doc,
e2e test tags, `data-cuj` markers, and the preview-recording generator.

**Inventory:** 🟢 live 27 · 🟡 partial 4 · 📝 draft 11 · ⚠️ deprecated 3 (total 45)

`Owner` is a shared journey library (the mechanics every owner performs), not a
persona. The Trader, Collector and DAO personas all reference it, so shared
journeys are defined exactly once. Ids are append-only: retired journeys are
marked deprecated, never deleted or renumbered.

## Personas

| Persona | Motivation | Journeys |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Domain Trader | Profit-driven — ruthlessly aims for return, flips for ROI. | `Owner.*` + `Trader.*` |
| Domain Collector | Emotion-driven — collects for association, curates and holds. | `Owner.*` + `Collector.*` |
| DAO / Org Controller | Wants shared, multi-sig control of a domain across an org/DAO. | `Owner.*` + `DAO.*` |
| Powered-by-Namefi Partner | White-label parent-domain owner issuing subdomains. | `PBN.*` |
| Developer / Integrator | Programmatic access to Namefi capabilities. | `Dev.*` |
| Visitor | Top-of-funnel / SEO — not yet a customer. | `Visitor.*` |
| Admin / Operator | Internal operations and support. | `Admin.*` |
| ~~Domain Hunter~~ (deprecated) | Community discovery / upvoting — being retired (unused). | `Hunter.*` |
